This tool allows you to change Level Of Detail for ATi/AMD cards on the fly (in-between GT loading screens i.e). 
It will support NVIDIA cards when they fix their nvapi (never).

Notes:
* To close the hotkeys monitor, press Ctrl+Alt+0 on your keyboard.
* The hotkeys monitor is written in AutoHotkey and will trigger false-positives with some antivirus software. Get the source code and compile it yourself if in doubt.
